# Uncommon JavaScript Bug: Unexpected Behavior with Null and Zero Values in Division

This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug related to handling null and zero values during division. The bug is characterized by unexpected behavior when the input values are null or zero, potentially leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in the naive handling of edge cases: null and zero values.

The provided `foo` function aims to safely divide two numbers, explicitly handling `null` values. However, it lacks robust handling for division by zero and doesn't validate the input types. This can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors.

## Bug Solution

The solution incorporates improved input validation and error handling. It checks for non-numeric inputs and explicitly handles the division by zero case, returning a suitable default value or throwing an error to indicate a problem.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and run the code. Observe the output.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` and compare the output with the original.

## Lessons Learned

This example highlights the importance of robust input validation and comprehensive error handling in JavaScript.  Always check for `null` and `undefined`, and always handle potential `NaN` or `Infinity` results from mathematical operations. When dealing with external data, assume that the data may be invalid or missing.  Use defensive programming practices to handle unexpected values gracefully and avoid unexpected behavior or runtime errors.
